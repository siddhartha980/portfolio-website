	 		<h1>Definition of Information Technology</h1>
	 		<p>The study, development, implementation, support or management of computerized IT â€“ particularly software and computer hardware. Information technology is the subject of research, design, development. IT staff help to make sure people work well with computers.<br>

			According to industry experts, almost every company, from a software design company, to the biggest company, to the smallest "mom & pop," requires IT staff that keep its businesses operating smoothly.<br>

			Most IT jobs fall within four broad categories: computer scientists, computer engineers, analysts of systems and computer programmers. The function and titles of the myriad jobs that are currently required must be familiarized to the HR managers who recruit IT staff.

	 		<p>As humans, we are always linked to many essential things in our daily lives.

	 		<h2>Following are the Positive impact of Information Technology:</h2>
	 		<p>Communication: without boundaries, we can communicate. It is getting faster as we can send an instant message with low costs, reducing costs and reducing power for delivery in a fraction of the time. Teleconferences and video conferences are available for this e-mail. By using videoconferencing technology, we feel like communicating with someone face to face that is beneficial for meeting or interacting.<br><br>

			Social Relationship: ICT provides the opportunity for contact and relationships in our daily routine with people around the world. We can connect people by e-mail, social networking websites and cellular telephones through the use of the Internet and the communication channel. It's time-saving and cost effective. There are newsrooms, group discussions are available to communicate simultaneously with a wide range of people.<br><br>

			Self-employment: ICT devices help us to make our work more easy. Without heavy overheads, we can create our own business shops, buy products and market sales and use the multimedia app in publicity camps. This increases sales and promotes small companies. We can make payment options through net banking and online payments.<br><br>

	 		<h2>Negative impact of Information Technology is given below:</h2>
	 		<p>Reduced face-to-face interaction: Today most people like communication online rather than conversation so that people are more individualistic and introverted. Another limitation is that our feelings or what we really want to say are not expressed by using emails or social networking sites. We therefore needed contact with them face to face to express our true feeling.<br><br>

			Physical activity/health problems decreased: By using ICT equipment, users can accept a longer sitting lifestyle. This is possible because of continued use to cause health problems such as headache, fats, heart disease, diabetes, repeated stress and eye strain problems, incorrect posture, pain in the neck, physical and mental stress, etc. Children stretch out through the Internet, watch cartoons that can stop them from going out and fear talking to other children. Children have a lot of fun. There is a lack of physical training in this kind of living and our health risk is increased.<br><br>

			Security/Privacy loss: each ICT device uses Internet connections and is integrated with a specific technology. Data must be stored as secure data so it needs to be protected against virus attacks and other malware releases every day. The risk of personal data loss is the use of the social networking website. Online payment when we use Net Banking, there is a risk that people will lose our money by fraud. You can put our money into your account.<br><br>

			Social disconnection: While the internet has reduced physical distances, it doesn't mean they're all more closely connected and in some respects emotional distance is increased. People are always busy and spend a day in their own virtual world. With family and friends, they forget the real world and become a formality. Kids spend more time in the virtual world too and with the use of ICT gadgets, they adopt misconceptions that lead to cyber crime and extra marital matters.
